# DecisionTree-SD201  project of Telecom Paris

The project consists in implementing an algorithm for the construction of a
decision tree, in the case when the dataset is static. The features can be binary, categorical or continuous.
The lables are all binary. ([0,1])

To do evaluation of this algorithm:

```
$ cd lab01
$ python main.py eval 10
$ python check_results.py eval 10
```
